            <p>Hello! My name is Catherine Gomez, and I'm a New Media artist. Birthed in the darkroom my artistic lens
                is, first and foremost, based in photography. I use hardware and software as a medium, to interpret race
                and trauma. This academic year I'll be dedicating myself to developing a community engagement based
                practice by working as an artist in residence at a Philadelphia school. During this time I'll be
                partnered with Taller Puertoriqueno and PSTV Live. Through professional development from Eric Booth,
                Stacy Holland, and Mike O'Bryan, I'll be training as a teaching-artist and honing communication and
                dissimenation skills.</p>
